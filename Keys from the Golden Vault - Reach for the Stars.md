# Reach for the Stars

*An Adventure for 3rd-Level Characters*

**Markos Delphi**'s curiosity has taken a tragic turn. A Far Realm entity called Krokulmar has taken control of Markos, compelling him to commit evil acts. At Krokulmar's command, Markos is using a book called *The Celestial Codex* to bring part of Krokulmar into the world. The book's rightful owner hired adventurers to retrieve *The Celestial Codex* and prevent Markos from using it, but these adventurers fell prey to the horrors of Delphi Mansion. A new group of adventurers—the player characters—must now complete the task. Meanwhile, Markos is close to accomplishing Krokulmar's goal.

Acquiring *The Celestial Codex* is the primary goal of this adventure, but the characters also have a chance to free Markos from the Far Realm entity's control. Body horror is a recurring theme in this adventure; before running it, discuss with your players their level of comfort with these elements.

## Adventure Background

![](img/adventure/KftGV/019-03-002.ch3-key.webp)

**Markos Delphi** grew up with an insatiable curiosity. Eventually, he had his fill of worldly knowledge and began delving into the arcane, eager to understand the secrets of the planes of existence. Raised in a family of scholars and academics, Markos wished to make a breakthrough discovery that would propel himself and his family to new heights.

This quest for understanding became Markos's obsession. He sequestered himself and his fellow researchers in the remote Delphi Mansion. Markos used astrology-based magic to attempt to contact other planes, and something finally answered him: an entity that called itself Krokulmar. This entity made a pact with Markos, granting insight into the multiverse in exchange for influence on the Material Plane. Markos assumed Krokulmar's intentions were benign.

Krokulmar hails from the Far Realm. In making its pact with Markos, Krokulmar corrupted the mansion and its residents, then eroded Markos's sense of self until he became eager to commit evil acts in Krokulmar's service.

Acting under Krokulmar's control, Markos visited one of his peers, a sage named Vasil Talistrome. Markos incapacitated Vasil and stole *The Celestial Codex* from the sage's library. In addition to containing lore about stars and the planes of existence, the book describes rituals that can be used to summon extraplanar entities. Krokulmar needs Markos to perform one of these rituals to bind a **fragment of Krokulmar** to the Material Plane.

Without any knowledge of the profane entity influencing Markos, Vasil Talistrome hired a warrior named Elra Lionheart to retrieve *The Celestial Codex*. Elra and three other adventurers traveled to Markos's mansion, where they witnessed a number of peculiar magical effects caused by Krokulmar's growing influence. One by one, they fell prey to the mansion's sinister occupants.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open their music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

>>"Greetings, operatives. Vasil Talistrome, a sage who works with the Golden Vault, has reported the theft of *The Celestial Codex*. This book contains rituals that, in the wrong hands, could be used to summon dangerous extraplanar entities. The book was stolen by a nobleman named **Markos Delphi**, who might be under the influence of some profane entity. Four adventurers hired to retrieve the book from Delphi Mansion have disappeared without a trace. We have good reason to believe they're dead. This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to travel to Delphi Mansion and retrieve *The Celestial Codex*. May you fare better than the last group. Good luck, operatives."
>>

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using the Golden Vault as the characters' patron, choose one of the following adventure hooks instead.

### Hired by Vasil

Vasil Talistrome, a human sage who lives in a city of your choice, hires the characters to retrieve *The Celestial Codex* from Delphi Mansion. Vasil doesn't want any harm to befall Markos, whom he still regards as a friend. Vasil is worried about what might've prompted Markos to steal the book and what he might do with the book's information.

The characters aren't the first group to receive this quest, as Vasil is quick to mention. The last group he hired was led by a human warrior named Elra Lionheart. Elra and her companions perished in Delphi Mansion. (Vasil paid for the casting of a *divination* spell that confirmed as much.)

#### Vasil's Reward

Vasil is prepared to pay 250 gp to each character if *The Celestial Codex* is safely delivered to him.

### Hired by Markos's Family

Shortly after Markos stole *The Celestial Codex* from the library of Vasil Talistrome, the incident was reported to Markos's wealthy family. Several family members are concerned about Markos and fear his recent studies have led him down a troubled path. One of Markos's family members hires the characters to travel to Delphi Mansion and stop Markos from doing anything that might hurt himself or others. The family member asks the characters to return *The Celestial Codex* to its rightful owner, preferably without harming Markos.

#### Reward

Markos's family is prepared to pay 100 gp to each character for delivering *The Celestial Codex* safely to Vasil Talistrome, plus an extra 150 gp each if the characters bring Markos home. (The family strongly prefers him to be alive but pays to have him raised from the dead if necessary.)

## Meeting Elra

The journey to Delphi Mansion can be as eventful as you wish. When the characters get within 1 mile of the mansion, they encounter a manifestation of the late Elra Lionheart.

Elra's spirit manifests as a disembodied head. In this form, Elra reaches out to the characters and provides some helpful information:

>>A ray of sunlight shines down on a tree stump by the side of road, and the disembodied head of a human woman appears above the stump.
>>
>>"My name is Elra Lionheart," says the head. "My companions and I died trying to retrieve *The Celestial Codex*. Heed my words, lest you too fall prey to the dangers of Delphi Mansion. Markos is using the book to conjure an otherworldly being not meant to exist in this world. Meanwhile, his purple-robed cultists busy themselves with eldritch experiments. Beware creatures that look like puddles of eyes and mouths. Beware the thing that has hooks for hands. And beware the mansion itself, for it transforms weirdly. Most of all, stop Markos before it's too late!
>>
>>"My companions and I had a camp on a bluff due south of the mansion. If you go there first, you'll find a backpack containing a map of the mansion and some notes we acquired from a dubious source. These might help you plan your approach. Best of luck!"
>>

The characters have a choice: go to Elra's camp or to the mansion.

At your discretion, Elra's spectral head can float alongside the characters as they explore Delphi Mansion. In this form, Elra can't be harmed, nor can she physically interact with her surroundings in any way. Moreover, Elra can't stray more than a few feet from the characters. But she can provide helpful advice if the characters get stuck and don't know what to do.

If you choose not to have Elra accompany the characters, her head fades away.

## Elra's Camp

Elra and her companions camped on a bluff that has an unobstructed view of the south wall of Delphi Mansion. The characters can locate the camp without difficulty.

A quick search of the camp yields a backpack containing a rolled-up map of Delphi Mansion. Give your players a copy of map 3.1 at this time.

Accompanying the map are some scraps of paper with notes written on them in Common. Elra and her companions obtained the map and notes from one of Markos's cultists, whom they caught leaving the mansion. The notes are as follows:

- "Markos has a room on the third floor where he performs rituals."
- "A cavernous room underneath the basement contains four large crystals—purpose unknown."
- "Mansion windows can be unlocked using the password 'Krokulmar.'"

![Map 3.1: Players' Map](img/adventure/KftGV/020-03-003.players-map.webp)

## Delphi Mansion

Members of the Delphi family are nobles known for their academic studies of the multiverse. Markos's ancestors built Delphi Mansion in a forest away from civilization so they could study in peace.

### Arriving at the Mansion

Once the characters are within sight of the mansion, read or paraphrase the following:

>>A three-story mansion stands alone in a clearing. It has alabaster walls, windows on all three levels, and a closed double door on the ground floor. The area around the mansion seems unnaturally quiet.
>>

### Delphi Mansion Features

The mansion has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings throughout the mansion are 20 feet high.
- **Doors.** The mansion's doors and secret doors are unlocked unless the text states otherwise.
- **Lighting.** The mansion is illuminated by *continual flame* spells cast on candles that are mounted to the walls.
- **Windows.** Each window is under the effect of an *arcane lock* spell. The password to circumvent the magical locks is "Krokulmar."

#### Eldritch Surges

Since the day Markos contacted Krokulmar, its presence has slowly warped Delphi Mansion and its residents. Krokulmar's influence is strongest in certain rooms. When a room's description calls for it, or whenever a creature casts a spell in Delphi Mansion, roll on the Eldritch Surges table to see how Krokulmar's influence manifests in that location. The surge lasts for 1 hour. Rolling on the Eldritch Surges table while a surge is already in effect causes the current surge to end.

> ##### The Entity
>
>Krokulmar, the entity at the center of this adventure, is an enigmatic being from the Far Realm. Krokulmar can serve any campaign, or you can replace it with a more suitable otherworldly being.

##### Eldritch Surges
|  d4 | Surge Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The air becomes heavy and malleable. The space in the room becomes *difficult terrain*. While in the room, creatures have a flying speed equal to their walking speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  2  | Doors and windows in the room grow biting teeth. A creature that passes through a door or window in the room must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) piercing damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.                                                                                                                                 |
|  3  | Illusory magic causes one to perceive objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations. While in the room, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  4  | An animated shadow of the creature that caused the surge appears in its space while it is in the room. Until the creature leaves the room, immediately after it makes an ability check, an attack roll, or casts a spell on its turn, the shadow makes a melee spell attack (+4 to hit) against a random creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 5 (2d4) necrotic damage on a hit. |

### Delphi Mansion Locations

Locations in Delphi Mansion are keyed to map 3.2.

![Map 3.2: DM's map](img/adventure/KftGV/021-map-3.02-dms-map.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/KftGV/022-map-3.02-dms-map-player.webp)
#### D1: Foyer

>>A sickly sweet scent hangs in the air of this dusty foyer. Two staircases rise from the hardwood floor to a balcony, and a glass chandelier hangs above the center of the room. Below the chandelier, the pelt of an owlbear has been made into a fine rug, its head staring at the entrance.
>>

The stairs climb to a balcony (*area D10*). The ceiling here rises 30 feet from the floor. The owlbear rug weighs 50 pounds.

#### D2: Dining Hallway

>>This L-shaped hall is lined with large paintings of members of House Delphi. The ones that feature knights in silvery suits of armor have their faces scratched off.
>>

A character who examines the armor in the paintings and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check recalls that the knights belong to an order of paladins that battles extraplanar threats.

#### D3: Dining Room

>>Chairs and candelabras accompany a large dining table. The heads of several deer are mounted on the walls.
>>

A **mimic** disguised as a stuffed deer head has attached itself to a blank wooden plaque mounted on a secret door in the south wall. Markos trained the mimic to guard the secret door, which leads to a hidden room (described below). The mimic attacks if a character comes within 5 feet of it.

***Hidden Room.*** The wooden plaque behind the mimic is a lever of sorts. A character who inspects the wall and succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check spots scratches around the plaque that suggest the plaque can be rotated in either direction. Doing so causes the secret door to swing inward, revealing a dusty room with several shelves. Lining the shelves are jars, most of which contain harmless liquids. Among these are six specimen jars, each containing one **slaad tadpole**.

Hiding in the dark corners of the hidden room are two **crawling claws**. If one or more characters enter the hidden room, the claws start pushing the jars with slaad tadpoles off the shelves and onto the ground, releasing the tadpoles. On its turn, a crawling claw can move to a specimen jar and take an action to release the slaad tadpole trapped within.

***Treasure.*** On the shelf along the dining room's west wall is a small box with the Delphi family crest (a purple eye) engraved on the lid. The box is unlocked. Inside is a bag that contains 150 gp and three *potions of healing*.

#### D4: Kitchen

>>This large kitchen is in poor condition. Flies cover foul-smelling messes of several meals stacked on a worktable in the middle of the room.
>>

The kitchen is in shambles. The half-eaten food on the cookery and plates has begun to rot.

**Chimney**. A fireplace in the middle of the east wall contains a black iron pot hung on a hook. The chimney is too narrow for Medium or Small characters to climb, but a Tiny creature could fit.

#### D5: Pantry

The pantry is well stocked, and the foodstuffs here haven't spoiled yet. A sack of potatoes rests against the east wall next to stairs that lead to the wine cellar (*area D23*).

#### D6: Parlor

>>Small circular pedestals dot the room, each one large enough to hold a couple of drinking cups. In the corners of the room stand four suits of armor. The two on the west side of the room are noticeably cleaner than the others.
>>

The two suits of **animated armor** on the west side of the room attack if a character comes within 5 feet of either of them. They fight until destroyed.

#### D7a: Empty Sitting Room

All furnishings and decorations have been removed from this room, leaving nothing but dust and cobwebs.

#### D7b: Room with a Secret

>>The walls of this sitting room are decorated with grim paintings, but all furnishings have been removed except a ten-foot-square rug in the middle of the floor and a sword mounted on the middle of the north wall.
>>

The rug is a **rug of smothering**, and the sword is a **flying sword**. They both attack if a character comes within 5 feet of either.

***Hidden Room.*** A secret door in the north wall (where the flying sword hangs when it isn't attacking) leads to a hidden room. A character who examines the north wall and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds the secret door, which pushes inward easily enough.

The hidden room has a pair of cobwebbed chairs at one end and a dusty table at the opposite end. Tucked under the table is a small wooden chest with handles.

***Treasure.*** The wooden chest is unlocked and holds three *spell scrolls* (*arms of Hadar*, *bane*, and *dimension door*) and a bag containing six pieces of jewelry worth 100 gp each.

#### D8a: Tower Ground Floor

>>A cold wind descends this tower staircase.
>>

The stairs here climb 20 feet to area D8b.

#### D8b: Tower Stairs

The stairs here descend 20 feet to area D8a and climb 20 feet to area D8c.

#### D8c: Stargazer's Roost

>>Rubble lies scattered across the floor where part of the roof has collapsed, revealing the sky. Perched atop the rubble is a hunched figure wrapped in a cloak. It gazes at the sky, unaware of you.
>>

![{@creature Zala Morphus|KftGV}](img/adventure/KftGV/023-03-004.zala-morphius.webp)

The cloaked figure is **Zala Morphus**, a human mage who has been transformed into a **nothic**. Zala helped Markos contact Krokulmar and blames this Far Realm entity for her transformation. Now she anxiously turns to the stars, hoping to find a way to return to her human form. Zala has no interest in Markos's current activities and little knowledge about them.

Zala speaks Common, Deep Speech, and Elvish. If the characters attack her, Zala responds in kind. If they claim to be looking for *The Celestial Codex*, Zala advises them to search Markos's office (area D11b) or his bedroom (*area D15*).

Zala wants a map of the Great Snake constellation from the star-map room (*area D21*). If the characters retrieve the map for her, Zala tells characters about the locked secret door in the wine cellar (*area D23*) along with the password ("farrl'v hrak").

***Treasure.*** Zala carries two *spell scrolls* (*crown of madness* and *sleep*) and a *spellbook* that contains the following spells: *arcane lock*, *detect magic*, *detect thoughts*, *knock*, *mage armor*, *magic missile*, *phantasmal force*, *shield*, and *suggestion*.

#### D9: Guest Bedrooms

These two adjacent rooms are furnished identically:

>>This dusty room contains a bed, a wardrobe, and a writing desk.
>>

The first character to enter the westernmost bedroom triggers a roll on the Eldritch Surges table.

The easternmost bedroom contains a **gibbering mouther**. It attacks any character who opens the door and fights to the death.

#### D10: Balcony

This balcony overlooks the foyer (*area D1*), the floor of which is 20 feet below.

#### D11a: Empty Office

All furnishings have been removed from this room, leaving nothing but dust and cobwebs.

#### D11b: Markos's Office

>>This room contains a black wooden desk with a cushioned, high-backed chair behind it. Two smaller chairs face the desk with their backs to the door. A niche in the northeast corner contains a wooden file cabinet.
>>

The first character to enter the office triggers a roll on the Eldritch Surges table.

***Correspondence.*** The file cabinet in the northeast niche is unlocked and contains correspondence between Markos and other nobles. You can decide if these letters are addressed to or written by anyone of significance to the characters.

**Desk**. The desk contains a complete set of *calligrapher's supplies*.

#### D12: Gallery

>>Framed portraits and alabaster busts of members of the Delphi family decorate the walls and corners of the room, with facial expressions ranging from proud to downright haughty. Four cushioned chairs surround a table in the center of the room, on which is displayed an ivory dragonchess set.
>>

**Treasure**. Two of the busts and five of the framed paintings are well made and in good condition, and each could fetch 50 gp from a collector. Each bust weighs 30 pounds, and each framed painting weighs 15 pounds. The ivory *dragonchess set* is worth 150 gp.

#### D13: Alchemy Lab

>>This room reeks of chemicals. A long table with various vials and compounds occupies the center of the room. At the table, two cloaked figures oversee various alchemical experiments.
>>

One of the cloaked figures is Markos's head researcher, Xander (lawful evil, human **cult fanatic**). The other figure is an apprentice named Kura (lawful evil, human **cultist**). Both have embraced the Far Realm entity and the power it offers. Xander and Kura are indifferent toward intruders and don't attack unless the intruders aim to harm them or hinder their research.

Xander and Kura don't keep track of Markos's movements, but they know he has been spending a lot of time in the caves below the basement (*area D27*). They assume *The Celestial Codex* is with Markos or in his bedroom (*area D15*).

***Treasure.*** Characters can assemble two sets of *alchemist's supplies* (50 gp each) from the contents of this lab. Among the various concoctions found throughout the room are four *potions of healing*, a *potion of gaseous form*, a vial containing *oil of slipperiness*, and a vial with one dose of *assassin's blood* poison (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

#### D14: Meditation Room

>>A fetid stench permeates this room, which is empty save for two small, bare tables standing against the west wall and an ornate rug in front of the window. Resting next to the rug is a wooden candlestick holding the melted stump of a red candle. A long pull-rope hangs from a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling.
>>

There's no obvious source for the horrible smell that lingers here. The first character who enters the room triggers a roll on the Eldritch Surges table.

Markos used to sit on the rug and meditate while pondering the forces of the multiverse, but he hasn't used this room in a while.

***Trapdoor.*** The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to the master bath (*area D17*). An unfolding wooden ladder allows easy access.

#### D15: Markos's Bedroom

>>This room contains a bed with an ornately carved frame, a wardrobe, a writing desk, and a leather chair. A fireplace stands along the east wall.
>>

Behind the headboard of the bed is a secret door to a hidden walk-in closet. A character who examines the wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers not only the secret door but also a secret button on the headboard. Pushing the button causes the bed to slide eastward, allowing easy access to the hidden closet.

**Hidden Closet**. This closet contains clothing on hooks and shelves, plus an assortment of footwear. On a small table against the east wall sits an iron lockbox. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 14 Dexterity check.

***Treasure.*** The lockbox contains an amethyst cloak pin shaped like an eye (125 gp) and a *ring of jumping*.

#### D16: Student Quarters

These rooms were set aside for Markos's pupils, who shared his drive for knowledge but didn't share in their master's reward for contacting Krokulmar. The pupils fled the mansion after Markos made his pact. Each room now contains two **psychic gray oozes** (see the "Variant: Psychic Gray Ooze" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*) that mill about. They attack intruders on sight.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the northernmost room find a *spellbook* that contains the following spells: *comprehend languages*, *detect magic*, *detect thoughts*, *identify*, *mage armor*, *misty step*, *Tasha's hideous laughter*, and *unseen servant*.

#### D17: Bathroom

>>A raised marble tub occupies this room. Near it are two marble sinks with oval mirrors mounted above them, a fireplace, and a small table against the east wall that has a colorful collection of bottles atop it.
>>

The tub and sinks have pipes that draw rainwater from cisterns on the roof. Further, each basin is equipped with a plugged drainpipe and two faucets: one that magically heats water and one that magically cools it.

***Treasure.*** Four bottles of perfumes and scented oils (25 gp each) sit on the small table.

![Alchemy is afoot in Delphi Mansion](img/adventure/KftGV/024-03-005.alchemy-is-afoot.webp)

#### D18: Third-Floor Hall

This hallway has become a lair for **stirges**—two per character. The stirges entered the mansion through the hole in the roof above area D8c. They attack anyone who tries to cross the hall.

#### D19: Eldritch Observation Room

>>This room is empty except for a circle of vile symbols on the floor. Standing in the circle is an eight-foot-tall, bipedal creature with two long arms, each one ending in a sharp hook. The creature wears the tattered remnants of a butler's uniform.
>>

The first character who enters the room triggers a roll on the Eldritch Surges table.

***Circle of Symbols.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the circle on the floor. A creature standing fully inside the circle feels the unsettling presence of a Far Realm entity and can choose to receive an omen from that entity, as if the creature had cast an *augury* spell. After receiving such an omen, the creature can't receive another one for 24 hours but still feels the otherworldly presence while inside the circle.

***Esquire.*** The hook-handed figure is Markos's former butler, Esquire (use the **hook horror** stat block). Esquire isn't bound inside the circle and attacks intruders on sight. He doesn't know the cause of his transformation. If the characters explain that an evil entity is responsible for Esquire's transformation or that Markos might be in danger from this entity, Esquire lets them live if they vow to save Markos.

Esquire's tattered butler uniform has a pocket containing a locket and a note. The locket is under the effects of a *magic mouth* spell; when opened, it speaks the password to the temple (*area D24*), "farrl'v hrak," which is Deep Speech for "forever changing." The note contains a sketch of a wine bottle and a row of four circles. The second circle from the left is crossed out. (The circles represent the casks in *area D23*, the crossed-out one representing the cask blocking a secret door.)

![A bubbling green potion contains a Far Realm surprise](img/adventure/KftGV/025-03-006.far-realm-surprise.webp)

#### D20: Component Storage

This walk-in closet contains four cabinets, each one filled with carefully organized material components.

**Treasure**. Characters who search the cabinets can find a material component for any 1st- or 2nd-level spell, provided the component has a value less than 1 gp. Characters also find a potion, its bubbling green liquid stained by a drop of some dark substance (octopus ink).

The alchemists in *area D13* concocted the potion, which functions as a *potion of poison* but has an additional property. When the poison effect ends, the imbiber sprouts a tentacle made of inky shadow. This shadowy tentacle lasts for 1 hour. As a bonus action, the potion's imbiber can use the tentacle to make a melee weapon attack (+4 to hit) against a creature the imbiber can see within 5 feet of itself. On a hit, the target takes 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

#### D21: Star-Map Room

The walls and floor of this room are covered with star maps. The **ghost** of an elf researcher named Farenhel wanders the room, looking through the maps and searching for an answer the ghost will never find. The ghost is harmless and attacks only in self-defense or if a character tries to steal a star map. The ghost stops attacking as soon as the stolen map is returned.

Characters who examine the maps closely find one that depicts a constellation called the Great Snake. This is the map sought by the nothic **Zala Morphus** (see area D8c).

#### D22: Storage Rooms

Each of these unfurnished rooms contains two **ghouls** that were attracted to the mansion by Far Realm energies. The ghouls are hostile.

#### D23: Wine Cellar

>>The faint aroma of grapes fills the air in this cellar. Four large wine casks stand against the west wall, a fine layer of dust covering each of them. The three wine racks to the south are empty.
>>

Three of the wine casks contain varying amounts of wine. The fourth cask is empty and positioned in front of a secret door in the west wall. Characters who examine the empty cask see handprints on it, suggesting it has been moved multiple times. The characters also feel cold air coming from the wall, suggesting the presence of a secret door. The wine cask must be moved aside to access the secret door.

**Secret Door**. An *arcane lock* spell has been cast on the secret door. The password to bypass the spell is "farrl'v hrak," which is Deep Speech for "forever changing." Esquire's locket (see *area D19*) speaks the password when opened.

Alternatively, a character can use an action to try to force open the locked secret door, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### D24: Temple

>>Four wooden pews face a stone statue in the middle of this torchlit chamber. The statue has a roughly bipedal shape and is carved to look like it's coming undone, like a frayed rope. Its form is covered with mouths and outstretched tongues.
>>
>>Standing before the statue are four purple-cloaked figures, their faces hidden by cowls. They are writing on pieces of paper and muttering to each other, oblivious to your presence.
>>

The arcane energies in this room are particularly volatile. The first character who enters the room triggers a roll on the Eldritch Surges table. After the surge begins, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), roll again on the Eldritch Surges table.

***Cloaked Figures.*** The cloaked figures are four neutral, human **cultists** who are taking notes on the eldritch surges that occur in this area. These cultists defend themselves if attacked but otherwise pose no threat. They know Markos is performing a ritual in *area D27* but won't share this information until the statue is destroyed.

**Statue**. The statue depicts Krokulmar and was created with the aid of a *spell scroll* of *stone shape*. Any creature that touches the statue for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

The statue amplifies the eldritch surges, which a character can ascertain by examining the statue and then succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the statue is destroyed, the eldritch surges stop occurring throughout the mansion. The statue is a Medium object with AC 17, 36 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### D25: Storage

>>Four severed heads and three headless bodies lie on the floor of this room, which also contains four small crates in the far corner.
>>

The severed heads and decapitated bodies belong to Elra Lionheart and her three human adventuring companions. The body of one of Elra's companions is missing (and can be found in *area D27*).

If Elra is with the characters (see "Meeting Elra" earlier in this adventure), she mourns her dead companions and hopes there might be a way to bring her and her friends back from the dead.

***Treasure.*** Four small crates rest in the northwest corner. One contains a set of gold-plated cups and plates worth 200 gp total. Another contains a *wand of magic missiles* hidden in a pile of straw. The third contains 20 days' worth of edible *rations*. The final crate contains a dozen *torches* and three flasks of *alchemist's fire*.

#### D26a: Vestry

This dusty chamber contains four unlocked wooden trunks, each of which contains four dark-purple silk robes.

#### D26b: Ceremony Room

>>Iron brackets bolted to the walls hold four sputtering torches that cast this otherwise empty room in dim light. On the far side of the room, a spiral staircase descends into darkness. From below, you hear a human voice chanting in a blasphemous tongue.
>>

The spiral staircase descends 20 feet to area D27. The voice rising up the stairs is chanting in Deep Speech, calling to an entity named Krokulmar.

#### D27: Ritual Room

This location consists of two roughly circular caves joined by an opening. The staircase from area D26b leads to the southern cave, which is empty. From the stairs, characters can see activity in the northern cave:

>>The staircase leads to a roughly circular cave that is empty and unlit. Opposite the stairs, though a twelve-foot-wide archway, you see a similar cavern lit by purple light emanating from four large crystals jutting from the floor. All crystals flicker in concert with the chanting that echoes through the caves.
>>
>>The chants come from a sallow, dark-robed figure who stands near the edge of a circle of arcane runes inscribed on the floor. The figure recites an eldritch passage from a book, then carefully sets the book atop a wooden crate near the back wall. The figure turns toward the circle, wherein kneels a **headless body** in plate armor. A sluglike creature has attached itself to the body's neck, almost like a makeshift head. The slug's form is covered with mouths and eyes that open and close in and out of existence.
>>

**Markos Delphi** is performing a ritual that will allow a **fragment of Krokulmar** (see their stat blocks at the end of the adventure) to attach to the **headless body** of one of Elra's adventuring companions, thus enabling a piece of Krokulmar to exist outside the Far Realm. The **headless body** is stunned and remains so until the ritual is complete. It is possible to attack the fragment without harming the **headless body**.

![The Celestial Codex](img/adventure/KftGV/026-03-007.the-celestial-codex.webp)

On each of his turns in combat, Markos defends himself while taking a bonus action to continue the ritual. If he's able to take this bonus action three more times, the **fragment of Krokulmar** takes control of the **headless body**, at which point the body is no longer stunned.

The **fragment of Krokulmar** and the body to which it is attached are considered two creatures occupying the same space. Neither can be separated from the other until one or both of them drop to 0 hit points, at which point the **fragment of Krokulmar** returns to the Far Realm. While under the fragment's control, the body uses the **knight** stat block, has blindsight within a range of 30 feet, is blind beyond this radius, and acts immediately after the fragment in the initiative order. The fragment determines what the body does on the body's turn.

The fragment uses the body to protect itself from harm and to destroy the characters.

***Helping Markos.*** As an action, a character can make a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check to try to convince Markos he's being controlled. If the check fails, nothing happens and the action is wasted. If the check succeeds, Markos has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of his next turn as he wrestles with the possibility that he's not in control of his actions.

**Crystals**. As a bonus action, a character can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) to ascertain the purpose of the large crystals sprouting from the floor. These crystals focus the ritual's extraplanar energy, allowing the **fragment of Krokulmar** to remain on the Material Plane long enough for it to bond with the **headless body**. A character who succeeds on the check also knows that destroying all four crystals stops the ritual. Each crystal is a Large object with AC 13, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

Each time a crystal is destroyed, Markos has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of his next turn as he confronts the possibility that he might not be in control of his actions.

**Ending the Threat**. If all four crystals are destroyed, if Krokulmar or the body it's attached to drops to 0 hit points, or if Markos drops to 0 hit points before the ritual is completed, the **fragment of Krokulmar** returns to the Far Realm. Sending the fragment back to the Far Realm ends the eldritch surges in Delphi Mansion, frees Markos from Krokulmar's influence (see "Conclusion" below), restores **Zala Morphus** and Esquire to their former human selves, and causes the cultists in area D24 to flee.

***Treasure.*** The book resting on the crate is The Celestial Codex. A *mage hand* spell can easily lift the book. An invisible character can sneak across the room and try to steal the book without Markos noticing, doing so with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, Markos detects the theft. Although he no longer needs the book to complete the ritual, Markos won't give it up without a fight while he's under Krokulmar's influence. Once free of that influence, Markos is horrified by his actions and gladly gives up the book (see "Markos Lives").

*The Celestial Codex* is filled with arcane lore about the stars and the planes of existence. Nestled among its benign descriptions are eldritch incantations written in Celestial, and tucked between the book's pages are two *spell scrolls* (*armor of Agathys* and *arms of Hadar*).

## Conclusion

If the characters obtain *The Celestial Codex*, they can return the book to its rightful owner and claim their reward.

### Markos Dies

If Markos dies, the characters can return his body to his family. The Delphi family gives each character 150 gp for bringing Markos home and pays to have Markos raised from the dead.

### Markos Lives

Defeating the **fragment of Krokulmar** frees Markos from the evil entity's influence, at which point Markos is eager to make amends for the trouble he has caused. He allows the characters to keep whatever treasure they found in the mansion.

If Markos is reunited with his family, the family gives 150 gp to each character as a reward.

### Dead Adventurers

If the characters recount the horrors of Delphi Mansion to Markos's family, the family makes arrangements to rid the mansion of any remaining monsters. The bodies of adventurers who were killed in the mansion (including Elra and her companions) are brought to a temple, where they are raised or resurrected at the Delphi family's expense. If the characters are present when Elra's life is restored, she congratulates them on their heroism and looks forward to one day repaying the favor.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, the organization's representative approaches them after their harrowing experience at Delphi Mansion. For returning *The Celestial Codex* to its rightful owner, the characters are promised an uncommon magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment. The item is delivered to the characters the next day.
