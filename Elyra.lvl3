Personality Traits:

    Ideal: "Life is a game, and I play to win. Trust is a luxury I can’t afford."
    Bond: "My skills are my lifeline. They were forged in shadow and tested in the dark alleys of the city."
    Flaw: "I can be reckless when I see an opportunity. Risks are my trade, but sometimes they are more than I bargained for."

Appearance: Elyra has striking features, a mix of elven grace and human strength. Her pale, almost ghostly skin is contrasted by her long, jet-black hair, which she keeps tied back when on a mission. Her eyes are a sharp, piercing blue, assessing everything with a calculating gaze. She is agile and lithe, dressed in dark, fitted leather armor with subtle runes that enhance her stealth and reflexes.

Personality: Elyra is cunning and resourceful, always ready to adapt to her surroundings. She speaks with confidence and a touch of humor, but never reveals too much about herself. Her loyalty is hard-won, but when earned, she protects those she cares about with fierce determination.
