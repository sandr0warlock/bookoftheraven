Appearance: Arkad is a tall, wiry man with a calculating look in his deep, dark eyes. His red robes, embroidered with arcane symbols and runes, mark him as a wizard of distinction, though his demeanor is as cold and distant as the shadow he often conjures. His hair is jet black, tied in a long, narrow braid, and his pale skin is marked with faint scars from past magical experiments.

Personality: Arkad is intense and focused, often appearing aloof or calculating as he analyzes situations for hidden knowledge and opportunities. He has an insatiable curiosity about the dark arts and is never afraid to push boundaries to achieve his goals, sometimes at the expense of morality.
